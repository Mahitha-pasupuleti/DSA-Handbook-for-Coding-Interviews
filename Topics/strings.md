# Topic Name: ðŸ§µ Strings

### Important Terminologies:
- Fixed-size Hash: Constant time hash for limited charset.
- KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt): Efficient pattern search algorithm.
- Rabin-Karp: Rolling hash pattern matching.

### Time Complexity:
- Best case: O(n)
- Average case: O(n)
- Worst case: O(n*m) (naive), O(n) (with KMP/Rabin-Karp)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Case sensitivity impacts string matching.
- Special characters and whitespace need careful handling.
- Rolling hash reduces recomputation in pattern matching.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty string.
- Strings with special or whitespace characters.
- Case sensitivity differences.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Anagram checking
- Palindrome detection
- Longest substring without repeating characters
