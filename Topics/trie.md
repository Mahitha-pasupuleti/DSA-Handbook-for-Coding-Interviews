# Topic Name: ðŸ”¤ Trie

### Important Terminologies:
- Trie Node: Each node stores children and end-of-word flag.
- Prefix Search: Finding words starting with given prefix.
- Autocomplete: Suggesting words from prefixes.

### Time Complexity:
- Insert/Search/Delete: O(m) where m = length of word.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Memory intensive compared to hash maps.
- Useful for dictionary and autocomplete applications.
- Can be implemented using arrays or hash maps.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty string insertion.
- Prefix is entire word.
- Overlapping prefixes.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Word dictionary implementation.
- Replace words in sentence.
- Prefix matching.
