# Topic Name: ðŸ§® Matrix

### Important Terminologies:
- Transpose: Flipping matrix over its diagonal.
- Zero Matrix: Matrix initialized with zeros.
- Spiral Order: Traversing matrix in spiral pattern.

### Time Complexity:
- Typically O(rows * cols) for traversal or transformation.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Use zip(*matrix) for transpose in Python.
- DFS and BFS useful for flood fill.
- In-place rotation is tricky but optimal.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty matrix.
- Single row or single column.
- Square vs rectangular matrices.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Matrix rotation
- Flood fill
- Spiral order traversal
