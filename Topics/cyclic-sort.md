# Topic Name: ðŸ”„ Cyclic Sort

### Important Terminologies:
- Cyclic Sort: Sorting numbers when they are in a range 1 to n.
- In-place Swap: Swap elements without extra space.
- Index-Matching: Element value matches its index+1.

### Time Complexity:
- Best, Average, Worst: O(n)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Does not use comparisons â€” uses swapping.
- Extremely space efficient.
- Detects duplicates/missing numbers efficiently.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Duplicate or missing elements.
- Zero or negative values (outside 1..n).
- Already sorted array.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Finding duplicates/missing numbers.
- Sorting range-limited elements.
- Place correct element at correct index.
