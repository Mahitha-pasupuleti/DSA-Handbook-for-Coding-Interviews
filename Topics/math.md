# Topic Name: âž— Math

### Important Terminologies:
- GCD/LCM: Greatest Common Divisor / Least Common Multiple.
- Modulo Arithmetic: Useful for large number operations.
- Prime Number: Number divisible only by 1 and itself.

### Time Complexity:
- Varies. Euclidean GCD is O(log min(a, b)).
- Sieve of Eratosthenes is O(n log log n).

### Less Known but Important Points:
- (a * b) % c = ((a % c) * (b % c)) % c
- Use fast exponentiation for power mod.
- Overflow risk with large factorials.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Zero and one.
- Negative numbers.
- Precision for floats.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Sieve for prime generation.
- GCD for array operations.
- Power mod / inverse mod.
