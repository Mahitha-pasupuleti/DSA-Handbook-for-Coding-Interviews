# Topic Name: üîÅ Recursion

### Important Terminologies:
- Base Case: Condition to stop recursion.
- Recursive Call: Function calling itself.
- Recursive Tree: Visualization of recursive calls.

### Time Complexity:
- Depends on recursion depth and branching.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Avoid stack overflow with base cases.
- Memoization reduces repeated calls.
- Tail recursion optimization not supported in Python.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Missing base case.
- Deep recursion stack.
- Input that causes exponential calls.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Divide and conquer.
- Backtracking.
- Tree
