# Topic Name: ðŸ“† Intervals

### Important Terminologies:
- Interval: Range defined by start and end.
- Overlapping intervals: Intervals that intersect.
- Merge intervals: Combine overlapping intervals.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting intervals: O(n log n)
- Merging: O(n)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Clarify whether touching intervals count as overlapping.
- Use heaps for meeting room problems.
- Nested intervals require careful handling.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Single interval.
- Fully nested intervals.
- Intervals with same start or end.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Merge intervals.
- Meeting rooms.
- Interval scheduling.
