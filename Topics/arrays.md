# Topic Name: ðŸ“Œ Arrays

### Important Terminologies:
- Subarray: Contiguous elements within an array.
- Subsequence: Non-contiguous elements maintaining relative order.
- Bitonic Array: Array which first increases then decreases.

### Time Complexity:
- Best case: O(n)
- Average case: O(n)
- Worst case: O(n)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Arrays have cache locality advantages over linked lists.
- Sliding window technique is optimal for many subarray problems.
- Prefix sums help optimize range queries.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty array.
- All negative values (especially for max subarray).
- Arrays with duplicates.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointer
- Prefix Sum
