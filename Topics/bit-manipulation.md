# Topic Name: ðŸ§® Bit Manipulation

### Important Terminologies:
- XOR: Useful for finding unique elements.
- Bit Masking: Use of bits to represent sets.
- Bit Shifting: Left/right shift for power of two calculations.

### Time Complexity:
- O(1) for most operations.
- O(log n) when looping over bits.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- n & (n - 1) removes the rightmost set bit.
- XOR of same number is zero.
- Count set bits with Brian Kernighanâ€™s algo.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Zero input.
- Negative numbers.
- Overflow in shifts.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Single number in pairs.
- Subset generation using bits.
- Count number of 1s.
