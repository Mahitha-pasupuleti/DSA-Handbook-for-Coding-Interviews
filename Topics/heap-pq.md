# Topic Name: ðŸ”º Heap / Priority Queue

### Important Terminologies:
- Min Heap: Smallest element at root.
- Max Heap: Largest element at root.
- Heapify: Process of building a heap.

### Time Complexity:
- Insert: O(log n)
- Extract Min/Max: O(log n)
- Peek: O(1)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Pythonâ€™s `heapq` is min-heap by default.
- Use negative values for max-heap behavior.
- Parent and child index formulas.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty heap.
- Duplicates.
- All elements equal.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Top K elements.
- Median in a stream.
- Merge k sorted lists.
