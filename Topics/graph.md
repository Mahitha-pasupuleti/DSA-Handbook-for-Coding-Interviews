# Topic Name: üåê Graph

### Important Terminologies:
- Adjacency List: Graph representation using lists.
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Graph with no cycles.
- Union-Find: Data structure for cycle detection.

### Time Complexity:
- BFS/DFS traversal: O(V + E)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Use adjacency list for sparse graphs.
- Topological sort on DAG.
- Cycle detection differs for directed/undirected graphs.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Disconnected graph.
- Graph with cycles.
- Self-loops.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- BFS shortest path.
- DFS backtracking.
- Topological sort.
