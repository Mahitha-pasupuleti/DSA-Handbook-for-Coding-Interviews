# Topic Name: ðŸ”— Linked List

### Important Terminologies:
- Singly Linked List: Nodes with single pointer.
- Doubly Linked List: Nodes with next and prev pointers.
- Circular Linked List: Last node points to first node.

### Time Complexity:
- Traversal: O(n)
- Insertion/Deletion at head: O(1)
- Searching: O(n)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Use dummy nodes to simplify edge cases.
- Linked lists have poor cache locality compared to arrays.
- Detect cycles using Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty list.
- Single node list.
- Cycle presence.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Two pointers (fast and slow).
- Reverse linked list.
- Merge k sorted lists (using heap).
