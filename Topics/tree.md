# Topic Name: ðŸŒ² Tree

### Important Terminologies:
- Inorder Traversal: Left, Root, Right.
- Preorder Traversal: Root, Left, Right.
- Postorder Traversal: Left, Right, Root.
- Level Order Traversal: BFS on tree.

### Time Complexity:
- Traversal: O(n)

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Skewed trees behave like linked lists.
- Height vs Depth difference.
- Lowest Common Ancestor important for many problems.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty tree.
- Single node tree.
- Skewed (left or right) trees.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- DFS traversals.
- Binary Search Tree (BST) properties.
- Path sum problems.
