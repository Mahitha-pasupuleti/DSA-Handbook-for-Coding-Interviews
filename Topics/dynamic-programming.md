# Topic Name: ðŸ§  Dynamic Programming

### Important Terminologies:
- Overlapping Subproblems: Same subproblems solved multiple times.
- Optimal Substructure: Solution to problem can be built from solutions to subproblems.
- Memoization: Top-down approach with caching.
- Tabulation: Bottom-up approach with iteration.

### Time Complexity:
- Typically O(n), O(nÂ²), or O(nÂ³) depending on state and transitions.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- DP problems usually involve choosing, skipping, or combining choices.
- 1D/2D arrays or hash maps commonly used for state representation.
- Identify recurrence relation early.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Zero input size.
- Negative numbers in state values.
- Integer overflow in recursive calls.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence
- DP on Strings, Grids, Trees
