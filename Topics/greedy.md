# Topic Name: ðŸ’° Greedy

### Important Terminologies:
- Greedy Choice Property: Locally optimal choice leads to global optimum.
- Optimal Substructure: Problem can be solved by optimal solutions to subproblems.

### Time Complexity:
- Generally O(n log n) due to sorting.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Greedy does not always guarantee optimal solution.
- Often used in interval and scheduling problems.
- Useful for Huffman coding and coin change (limited cases).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Input order sensitivity.
- Equal weights/values.
- Edge cases violating greedy property.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Activity selection.
- Interval partitioning.
- Huffman encoding.
