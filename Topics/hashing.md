# Topic Name: üó∫Ô∏è Hash Map / Hash Set

### Important Terminologies:
- Hash Map: Key-value pairs with O(1) average access.
- Hash Set: Unique elements with O(1) average operations.
- Collision: When multiple keys hash to same index.

### Time Complexity:
- Insert/Access/Delete: O(1) average, O(n) worst case.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Python uses dict and set.
- Useful for frequency counting, memoization.
- Avoid mutable keys in hash maps.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Duplicate keys.
- Non-existent keys.
- Mutation during iteration.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Two sum using hashmap.
- Frequency map for anagram detection.
- Caching/memoization.

### Relevant LeetCode Problems:
