# Topic Name: üîô Backtracking

### Important Terminologies:
- Backtracking: Try out all options and undo when needed.
- State Space Tree: Tree representing all solution candidates.
- Pruning: Skip unnecessary branches early.

### Time Complexity:
- Generally exponential, O(k‚Åø) or O(n!) depending on permutations/combinations.

### Less Known but Important Points:
- Often confused with DFS ‚Äî but backtracking undoes choices.
- Can be combined with memoization for optimization.
- Classic tool for constraint satisfaction problems.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- No solution case.
- Duplicates in input affecting permutations.
- Maximum depth reached early.

### Common Coding Interview Patterns:
- Subsets and permutations.
- N-Queens / Sudoku Solver.
- Word search / Path finding.
